# data_science_ML_lessons_biology
Archives jupyter notebooks with tutorial lessons on data science/machine learning using Python with a life-science perspective. When I started learning programming and machine learning, most of the examples were from other fields like IT or business, so sometimes  I found it difficult to apply those skills to biological problems. My aim is to help make data science and machine learning more relatable, less intimidation, and practical to beginners, especially in my major biology by sharing the skills and knowledge I have acquired. Happy Learning!
Feel free to share with me what type of exploratory data analysis or modelling workflow you would like me to demonstrate!
